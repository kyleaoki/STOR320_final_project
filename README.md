#### All of the plots were created by myself.
#### The "Data" section was written by myself.

In this project, we used both linear and logistic regression to analyze a dataset of approximately 5,000 moives.
For linear regression, we asked the question: What factors determine the IMDB score of a movie?
For logistic regression, we asked the question: What factors determine the profitability of a movie?

Our central finding was that the factors which postitively influence the IMDB score of a movie are different
from the factors which positively influence the profitability of a movie. In other words, the variables which
increase the IMDB score, i.e. the degree to which movie-goers enjoy a movie, are not the same variables which
maximize the profits of the production company. This concerning, as it suggests a mismatch between
consumer tastes and preferences and what is conducive to profits in the movie business. Typically,
we expect that, since there exists a free market, firms will be forced to cater to the consumer's tastes
and preferences. However, this project demonstrates that this is not necessarily the case.
